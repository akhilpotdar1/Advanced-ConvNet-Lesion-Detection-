# Abstract:
Medical imaging and CAD is one of the most challenging and important futuristic artificial intelligence work which has been carried out since the past few decades. A major milestone in this development is image detection in CT scan reports of medical imaging. As a part of this exploratory study we attempted to locate the lesion using comparatively less computational power on the DeepLesion dataset from PACs. Our unique approach divided the entire project into two phases, first phase involved building a model for the classification of the CT images into the different anatomical parts and the second phase focused on locating the lesion in each of these body parts. As a result we have achieved 95% classification accuracy and we were successful in locating the lesion. The paradigm of occurrence for lesion is detected as we go deeper into the convolutional layers.

# Introduction:
1. Convolution neural networks have proven to be highly significant in the field of biomedical image processing and have provided extremely insightful predictions in models concerning object classification and detection.
2. Our dataset, named DeepLesion, is composed of 32,735 lesions in 32,120 bookmarked CT slices from 10,594 studies of 4427 unique patients. We have used a subset of 9816 images containing the CT scans of all the 8 body parts for both classification and lesion detection.
3. In our project, we have undertaken the challenge of locating the lesion without the use of a pretrained network.
4. The use of CNNs to locate the lesion for different body parts is not just interesting but equally challenging since each of part has a different structure and the location of the lesions are random.
